             <p>
                 
                My name is Ariadne and I am a Computer Science major at Bard College. I am currently 
                a rising junior and I will graduate from Bard in 2020. 
                My email is ftidca@gmail.com.

                My mentor this summer is Victoria Interrante. She is a Professor in the Department 
                of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Interrante 
                studies applying insights from visual perception and cognition to the development 
                of more effective virtual reality experiences and the more effective communication
                of complex information through visual imagery. Her website can be found

            <h2> My Projects </h2>
            <p>
                During my time in Minnesota so far I have worked on two projects. One of 
                the projects is developing a 2D video game interface for a robot designed 
                to help stroke patients regain control of their wrist movements. The robot 
                was designed in Dr. Jurgen's lab here at the University of Minnesota. The 
                robotic arm helps patients who have suffered a stroke them with the exercises 
                they need to do to for regaining motion and sensory control over their arm. 
                However, these exercises are extremely repetitive and boring. Many patients 
                never complete them because of this. One of the projects that I will be 
                working on this summer is designing a game that will work with the robot to 
                try and make it more enjoyable for the people using the device so that they 
                complete their exercises and are able to regain more function of their arm.
                <br><br>
                Another project that I will work on this summer will be using virtual reality to see if 
                the size of the elements in wallpaper patterns effects how big people perceive a room to 
                be. Virtual reality provides us with a way to immerse people in different 
                environments without having to physically build these environments. It also 
                allows us to control for many other factors such as lighting, room size, 
                ceiling height, ect. We will see if the scale of the wallpaper texture effect 
                both people's subjective judgement of the spaciousness of a room and their action 
                based egocentric judgements of distance in a room.
