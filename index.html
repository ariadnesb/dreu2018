                Hi, I am just learning how to use html/css for the first time so this website is a 
                work in progress! I needed to submit the url for the second milestone but I still 
                have a lot of work to do with this. <br><br>
                 
                My name is Ariadne and I am a Computer Science major at Bard College. I am currently 
                a rising junior and I will graduate from Bard in 2020. My email is ftidca@gmail.com.
                <br><br>
                My mentor this summer is Victoria Interrante. She is a Professor in the Department 
                of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Interrante 
                studies applying insights from visual perception and cognition to the development 
                of more effective virtual reality experiences and the more effective communication
                of complex information through visual imagery. Her website can be found
