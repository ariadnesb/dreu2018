        <h2> Week 1 </h2>
        <p>
            This week I got settled in at the University of Minnesota. I talked to 
            Dr. Interrante about possible projects for the summer. I think I have 
            decideced to work with some collaborators of Dr. Interrante's. These collaborators
            have developed a robotic arm to help people who have suffered from strokes with
            the exercizes they need to do to for regaining motion and sensory control 
            over their arm. I will be designing a gmae that will work with the robot
            to try and make it more enjoyable for the people using the device.
