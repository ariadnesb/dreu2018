        <h2> Week 1 </h2>
        <p>
            This week I got settled in at the University of Minnesota. I have met Dr. Interrante and the four other students that are joining the lab this summer. We all talked to Dr. Interrante about possible projects for the summer and started learning how to use Unity and Unreal, the two software programs that the lab uses for most of the work they do in virtual reality. I think for now I have decided to work on a project with some collaborators of Dr. Interrante's. These collaborators have developed a robotic arm to help people who have suffered from strokes.

        <br><h2> Week 2 </h2>
        <p>
            At the beginning of the week I met with the collaborators from the other lab and we discussed the constraints of the robot and how the game should be designed. It will be important for the game to target three different axises of motion; up-down, right-left, and rotational motion in the wrist. The game will need to be able to target these axises individually as well as emphasis both discrete and continuous motion along each of these axises. I spent the week brainstorming and storyboarding possible ideas for games.

        <br><h2> Week 3 </h2>
        <p>
            This week I started working on a different project. With two fo the other students in the lab we all worked together to try and do the wallpaper project in two weeks. This week we made a set of seven different sized rooms in Google SketchUp (smallest room 4m x 4m, largest room 6m x 6m). We then imported them into Unreal and created a version of each room with wallpaper with small elements, medium elements, large elements, extra large elements and just solid walls. We experimented with how big the wallpaper elements should be and how big the rooms should be and ended up with a set of 35 different rooms. We then worked on randomizing the order that that rooms would appear in for each participant and the location that they would be in in each room.

        <br><h2> Week 4 </h2>
        <p>
            We continued working on the wallpaper project. We finished implementing all the randomization and the capture of the necessary information for each participant. We then ran the experiment. We ended up running a total of fifteen participants and each participant took a little under an hour. After we ran all the participants we analyzed our data and wrote it all up for a conference paper that we submitted on July 4th.         </p>
