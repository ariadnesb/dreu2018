        <h2> Week 1 </h2>
        <p>
            This week I got settled in at the University of Minnesota. I have met Dr. Interrante and the four other students that are joining the lab this summer. We all talked to Dr. Interrante about possible projects for the summer and started learning how to use Unity and Unreal, the two software programs that the lab uses for most of the work they do in virtual reality. I think for now I have decided to work on a project with some collaborators of Dr. Interrante's. These collaborators have developed a robotic arm to help people who have suffered from strokes.

        <p>
            At the beginning of the week I met with the collaborators from the other lab and we discussed the constraints of the robot and how the game should be designed. It will be important for the game to target three different axises of motion; up-down, right-left, and rotational motion in the wrist. The game will need to be able to target these axises individually as well as emphasis both discrete and continuous motion along each of these axises. I spent the week brainstorming and storyboarding possible ideas for games.
